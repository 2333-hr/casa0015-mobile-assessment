## Landmark Hopper: Explore Your World with Insight

Landmark Hopper is an APP for city landmark visitors. Its intuitive user interface shows users the geographical coordinates of their current location and displays landmarks within a selected range through a built-in search function. Not only that, each landmark is accompanied by real-time weather information such as UV intensity, temperature, precipitation rate, and the specific location of these landmarks on Google Maps, providing users with instant and detailed local information.

We also encountered challenges while writing this app. In particular, integrating multiple APIs—Google Maps and OpenMeteo—into a cooperating whole requires precise coding and careful design. The result is an app that can be easily deployed across multiple platforms, giving users a consistently high-quality experience whether they are using Android, iOS, or a web browser.
